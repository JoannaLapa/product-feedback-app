### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt Vue.js basic concepts, Pinia basics, Tailwind CSS, validation forms with Vuelidate library. I've also learnt how to created reusable components with Vue 3.

### Continued development

At this moment I focus on learning Vue.js and I continue to deepen my knowledge of JavaScript. I am going to learn about testing the application and Typescript.
